1. Create a tracking reward system for studying/working/gaming
2. Project will be separated into 4 phases
	  1. First phase will be to create the simple interface using `tkinter` python module, and create basic logic to track certain programs and websites, and based on how many minutes is spend on those programs and websites, it will award 0,5 points for each minute. Afterward it will save that to a JSON or CSV file with the name of program, duration and earned points ^8f0338
	2. After the functionality is 100% working, the second phase will focus on creating a more modern and intuitive GUI so that it will not look like windows 98(nothing wrong with that but still), after the GUI is finished, third phase will begin
	3. Third phase will be opposite of first one, as in the project will be able to spend earned points. The goal is to create a incentive for study, where the reward will be Entertainment/Media. First the project will earn points based on time spend studying/working (0,5 points for one minute), and afterward i can use those points for games, however, the incentive or motivation here is that every minute of gaming will use 1 point. So when study for 60 minutes, i will earn 30 points, which would earn me 30 minutes for gaming. Thus creating a motivation for study and work, to reward some gaming time. And after the points are all spend, the program will close the game automatically, so it will work kind of like those game machines where you buy credit, and after the credit is spend you cannot play anymore
	4. And the final phase would be to integrate it with AWS services, use cloud databases, and create a final web application.
